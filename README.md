## Automated-Preprocessor
An automated data pre-processor which preprocesses the dataset and feeds out a clean dataset along with the option to locally upload it onto a database and maintain a log.
The database part is automated so it only requires minimal to no querying, furthermore this can be used to build models by directly pipelining data from the database.
